1. What is the maximum SPI clock frequency? Assume Vcc = 3.3V. 5 MHz
2. How much earlier the CS needs to be pulled down before the first rising edge of the clock? Assume mode 0,0. 100 ns
3. What is the data set-up time, i.e. how much earlier the data must be stable prior to rising edge of the clock? 18 ns
4. What is the maximum time you can expect from succesful serial data write to change in GPIO outputs? 500 ns
5. How many configurable registers MCP23S17 has? 21 registers
6. What is the required pattern you need to write over SPI in order to set GPB0 to logic ‘1’? Use hexadecimal notation and don’t forget the control/address word(s)
	a. Assume that slave address[3:1] is “000”
	b. Use IOCON.Bank = ‘0’. This means: 3-3 and 3-5 has correct register address mappings
	c. TIP: You don’t need to write to every register in the chip – have a look at the power-on-reset (POR) values of the registers – if they are ok, just leave them. Focus only on the ones which needs to be changed.
